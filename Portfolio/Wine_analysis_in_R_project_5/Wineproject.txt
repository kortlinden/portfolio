##Red wine analysis by Kort Linden

This data set is about the chemical make up and quality test scores of red wine. I am setting out to find what qualities might show a relationship to taste test scores and the various chemical attributes' relative correlations.

# Summary of data
There is 1599 objects and 13 variables in this set.
If we look at the names:
[1] "X"                    "fixed.acidity"       
 [3] "volatile.acidity"     "citric.acid"         
 [5] "residual.sugar"       "chlorides"           
 [7] "free.sulfur.dioxide"  "total.sulfur.dioxide"
 [9] "density"              "pH"                  
[11] "sulphates"            "alcohol"             
[13] "quality"             

# Some initial thoughts about the data
We can imagine that pH, acidities, and alcohol might be be 
naturally related.  X looks to just be a key identifier 
number and is not needed.
The strongest alcohol content is 14.90 percent and the lowest 
is 8.4 percent. The median quality score is a 6 with a mean 
of 5.636 and a max of 8.  The lowest quality score was a 3 yuck!  
I would also bet that sulfur dioxide is negativly 
related to quality score since sulfites are often found in lower quality wines as far as I know.

# Univariate Plots Section

In the following twelve graphs, I am taking a first look at the variables.
I will mostly be looking for abnormal distributions and outliers.

# Univariate Analysis Summary


The distributions that seemed  abnormal were:
Alcohol, Residual Sugar, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Sulphates, Volatile 
Aciditiy, Citric Acid, Chlorid, and Total Sulfur Dixoide.  The 
most common issue was a left skew, followed by long tails and some
with extreme outliers.

# Bivariate Analysis Summary

I used ggpairs to analyze the correlation and 
distributions of the variables.
Scatter plots varied, but for our main variable 
that I am interested in, "Quality",
you can see the distribution forms in stripes 
due to the fact that scores were whole 
numbers  3,4,5,6, 7, or 8.  

The most related of all the paired variables were:
1. Fixed.acidity and pH, with a corrcoef of -.68
2. Density and Fixed.acidity with a corrcoef of .68
3. Total sulfur dioxide and free dioxide with a corrcoef of .67 
though I believe that free dioxide may be a subset of total 
sulfur dioxide.

The most related of all the variables to Quality:
1. Alcohol to Quality with a corrcoef .48
2. Sulphates to Quality with a corrcoef .25
3. Citric.Acid to Quality with a corrcoef .23



Wow, who knew that 48% of a taste test result could 
potentially be explained by the 
quantity of alcohol?

# Multivariate Analysis

Treating quality as a categorical variable allows us to 
see some really interesting scatter plots. We can see beyond the .48 
correlation coefficient and say that the mean alcolhol levels 
for 7 and 8 wines was much higher than the rest, but now always.  However, 3 and 
4 quality wines had a higher mean alcohol than 5 wines which had a very 
tight quartile range comapred to the other categories and had the lowest mean.
Finally citric acid showed some of the most dramatic differences 
in means from one category to the next although the usefulness for prediction 
was less evident as we saw more crossing and convergence in the quality
trend lines.

# Final Plots and Summary



### Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}

library(ggplot2)


ggplot(aes(factor(quality), 
            alcohol), 
        data = wine) +
  labs(caption="The correlation coffecient is .4761, and is 
      the highest between any variable and Quality. However, if we look at the graph, 
      the correlation coefficient is not an accurate predictor for wines with a quality
      score of 6 or less.") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(wine$alcohol),
        max(wine$alcohol), by = 0.5),1)) +
  geom_jitter( alpha = .3)  +
  geom_boxplot( alpha = .5,color = 'green')+
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", 
               geom = "point", 
               color = "red", 
               shape = 8, 
               size = 4) + 
  xlab('Quality Rating') +
  ylab('Alcohol Percent') +
  ggtitle('Alcohol and Taste Quality Rating') 

```

The above plot shows the various wine alcohol contents for our sample across
the range of quality scores. There is a clear positive correlation, though
not very strong. A 7 or 8 quality wine rarely has an alcohol 
content under 10 percent. I used an alpha of 1/8 to reduce over plotting.


### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}
ggplot(aes(factor(quality), 
            citric.acid), 
        data = wine) +
  labs(caption="Correlation coffecient is .23 and is 
      the third highest between any variable and Quality. And, 
      we can see that the means are linear across quality scores.") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(wine$citric.acid),
        max(wine$citric.acid), by = 0.1),1)) +
  geom_jitter( alpha = .3)  +
  geom_boxplot( alpha = .5,color = 'green')+
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", 
               geom = "point", 
               color = "red", 
               shape = 8, 
               size = 4) + 
  xlab('Quality Rating') +
  ylab('Citric Acid Percent') +
  ggtitle('Citric Acid and Taste Quality Rating') 
```

Repeating the box plot for the third most related variable,
citric.acid, shows suprisingly that the wine qualities 
of 7 and 8 have vastly higher amounts of citric acid.  If you
are trying to pick a top quality wine, 7 and up, 
this variable is about as important as alcohol even 
though the overall correlation coefficients were very different
when considering all scores.  If I were to further analyze this,
I may group citric acid scores into 3 groups low, middle, high
if I were going to use it in a prediction algorythm since the
means for the 3 & 4, 5 & 6, 7 & 8 are very similar to eachother.
There are some outliers, and most are in the 7 category.  


### Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Plot_Three}
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, 
           y = sulphates  , color = factor(quality)), 
       data = wine) +
       labs(caption="Means show a positive, but not totally linear relationship
          for alcohol and quality.  If we look at wines with an alcohol content 
          above 14 percent, the correlation ends because only wines with a quality
          score of 6 contain alcohol content above 14 percent. On the other hand,
          we see a stacking of the trend lines along the sulphates y axis.  
          The lines are almost completely separate with just a tiny over 
          lap on either end of the alcohol spectrum. Sulphates and alcohol 
          have a slightly negative correlation.") +
      ggtitle('Alcohol, Sulphates, and Quality scores') +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.9, size = 1) +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(wine$alcohol), 
        max(wine$alcohol), by = 0.5),1)) +
      scale_y_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(wine$sulphates), 
        max(wine$sulphates), by = 0.1),1)) +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE,size=1)  +
      xlab('Alcohol Percent') +
      ylab('Sulphates Percent') +
  scale_color_brewer(type='seq',
                   guide=guide_legend(title='Quality'))

```


This graph illustrates the relationship of quality to its two
most correlated values: Alcohol and sulphates. 
It appears that to be an 8 quality score wine, the wine must reside in the upper right
quadrant and have high citric acid levels.  The 8 wines
almost always have to have an alcohol content above 11 and have at
least a .2 citric acid and sulphates of at least .6.  3 and 4's are
the most diverse but 5's typically have a much higher alcohol content
- as high or higher than most 8's but they lack in the other factors
like sulphates and (citric acids not shown above).

# Reflection

I was suprised that you could take a subjective score, albiet from trained
testers, and have muiltiple facets of the objective data correlate.  When
I used ggpairs, I saw that about half of the variables had fairly normal 
distributions.  On the other hand, many had left skew as well.  I think it 
is extremely important to make sure you as to whether the data is categorical
or continuous.

This data set's smaple size is not huge and contains one wine from one county.
Therefore, we would need more data to create a meaningful prediction model. 
However, it does show promise for predicting wine quality based on chemical 
factors given a more expansive sample.

When it comes to quality taste score, the data is clear that alcohol plays a 
clear roll; however, the signifigance of the suphates and citric acid levels 
is debatable unless you apply it to specific quality categories.  For future
studies, I would recommend analyzing price and grouping categories 3-5 into 
a low quality wine category to reduce noise and increase the correlation for
those wines of a 6 and up quality score.
