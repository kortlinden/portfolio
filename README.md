Kort Linden, Data Analysis Portfolio

About me:
I am 29 years old, and I hold a BS in Business Administration from Babson College. I recently completed my Nano-Degree in Data Analysis from Udacity.com. Under "portfolio", you will find the seven final projects that I
completed for my Nano-Degree.

Additionally, I have several projects (currently submitted for industry
conferences) that I have worked on with Juan Mundel of DePaul University in
the field of advertising and consumer research (available upon request).

After completing my business degree, I opened a series of five retail iPhone
repair stores in two states.  I exited the business and left Ann Arbor, MI for
personal reasons and started a one-man custom furniture business out of my
basement workshop in Lansing, MI. While this was a nice change of pace, I started
my 400+ hour Nano-Degree program in February, knowing that I was going to make
a career change when I moved to Chicago with my spouse later in the year.

I have relocated to Chicago, and have had the opportunity to learn many new
skills including advanced statistical analysis and presentation using
python, R, sqlite, Pandas, Machine learning with Scikitlearn, Tableau,
Jupyter Notebook, Github and more.

I am excited to find a business or data analyst position where I can add value
and continue to grow my repertoire of analysis and machine learning skills.

For reference, my Nano-Degree consisted of the following sections which
correspond to the portfolio projects in this Github repository:

Core Curriculum

7 PARTS
7 FINAL PROJECTS

PART 1
Welcome to the Nanodegree

Get started on your Nanodegree and learn how to make the most of Udacity's resources!

You’ll also do your first project analyzing bike rental data. It’s a great project to tackle during the first week in your Nanodegree to see if the program is a good fit for you!

PART 2
Statistics

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results. Use the Statistics Placement Advisor to determine if reviewing any of the Statistics course will help you prepare for this project.

PART 3
Intro to Data Analysis

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

PART 4
Data Wrangling

Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply your chosen schema to the project.

PART 5
Exploratory Data Analysis

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and relationships.

PART 6
Intro to Machine Learning

Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

PART 7
Data Visualization

Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
